# Tools on Cloud-V

## Using Environment Modules

Users can use environment modules to load different versions of same program. For using environment modules the pattern is as follows:

```shell
module load <PACKAGENAME/VERSION>
```  

For example if you want to load python version 3.9.2 compiled for x86, you will need to use following command:  

```shell
module load python/3.9.2
```  

For packages compiled for RISC-V architecture host, you will need to append `_riscv` to package name. For example, for python 3.8.15 compiled for RISC-V, following command will be used.  

```shell
module load python_riscv/3.8.15
```

Following are the tools and libraries available in Cloud-V.

## Tools on `x86_runner1` and `qemuusermode_runner1` node

Tools which are mentioned for `x86` architecture are able to run on`x86_runner2`. Tools which are mentioned for `RISC-V` architecture are able to run on `qemuusermode_runner1`.  

The packages which are supported for `QEMU User mode` can be used by normal commands once they are loaded.

Here `PACKAGE_NAME` is the package which you want to run on QEMU user mode.

**Operating System:** Debian 11 (bullseye)  
**QEMU User Mode Version:** 7.1.0
